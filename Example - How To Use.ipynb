Yacobucci', 'publishedDate': '2007', 'description': 'Over one million Americans are employed in manufacturing motor vehicles, equipment and parts. But the industry has changed dramatically since the U.S. \"Big Three\" motor vehicle corporations (General Motors, Ford and Chrysler) produced the overwhelming majority of cars and light trucks sold in the United States, and directly employed many people themselves. By 2003, most passenger cars sold in the U.S. market were either imported or manufactured by foreign-based producers at new North American plants (so-called \"transplant\" facilities). The Big Three now dominate only in light trucks, and are also now being challenged there by the foreign brands. The Big Three have shed about 600,000 U.S. jobs since 1980, while about one-quarter of Americans employed in automotive manufacturing (nearly 300,000) work for the foreign-owned companies. It is clear that the U.S. automotive industry has undergone many drastic changes that have had a net adverse effect on American interests. This book examines the causes of these changes. Congressional acts, increasingly stringent emission laws, the effects of NAFTA, labour unions and globalisation are all within the scope of this book.', 'url': nan, 'source_type': 'book'}, page_content='many drastic changes that have had a net adverse effect on American interests.

In particular, we wish\\nto understand the association between an employee’s ageandeducation , as\\nwell as the calendar year, on his wage. Consider, for example, the left-hand\\npanel of Figure 1.1, which displays wageversusagefor each of the individu-\\nals in the data set. There is evidence that wageincreases with agebut then\\ndecreases again after approximately age 60. The blue line, which provides\\nan estimate of the average wagefor a given age, makes this trend clearer.\\nGiven an employee’s age, we can use this curve to predicthiswage. However,\\nit is also clear from Figure 1.1that there is a significant amount of vari-\\nability associated with this average value, and so agealone is unlikely to\\nprovide an accurate prediction of a particular man’s wage.\\n© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023 \\nG.
